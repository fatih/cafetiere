Cafetiere is an iOS app let you make beautiful coffee. It has several nice and
thought features. This is the complete source code of that app. I'm making it
open-source because I don't have any plans to maintain it anymore. Feel free to
fork it. 

And lastly, the code itself was written on my initial obj-c learning phase,
therefore it's not perfect and you will see definetly a lot thinks that
doesn't make sense. However my plan was not to write the perfect code, I
just wanted an app and learn the whole app ecosystem.
